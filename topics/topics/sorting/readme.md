Insertion sort. 
Best case: O(n) , If the list is already sorted, where n is the number of elements in the list.
Average case: O(n 2 ) , If the list is randomly ordered
Worst case: O(n 2 ) , If the list is in reverse order

- Stable sorting algorithm. Order of equal elements is preserved.
- space efficient. 


### Count sort
- [gfg](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/counting-sort/)
- good for small values. faster than merge & quick for small values. 
- inefficient for larger values.
