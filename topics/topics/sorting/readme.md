Insertion sort. 
Best case: O(n) , If the list is already sorted, where n is the number of elements in the list.
Average case: O(n 2 ) , If the list is randomly ordered
Worst case: O(n 2 ) , If the list is in reverse order

- Stable sorting algorithm. Order of equal elements is preserved.
- space efficient.
